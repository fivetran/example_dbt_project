### Example repository to use with Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core™
This repository can be used as a template to get up and running quickly with Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core™. We do recommend developing your models using dbt Core or dbt Cloud. More info can be found @ https://www.getdbt.com/

# Step 1 (Create a GitHub account)
If you haven't already, create a GitHub account. There are free plans available.

# Step 2 (Copy this repository)
Navigate (you are already here!) to this repository and click 'Use This Template'

Then, name your repository something like this

# Step 3 (Customize your repository to mirror your Fivetran connectors)
We need to make a few changes to this repository to integrate with your Fivetran account.

***If you are interested in trying out Fivetran Data Models to transform your SaaS connetor data, please follow these steps:***

## Navigate to the Data Model(s) of interest
(https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/data-models#fivetrandatamodels)

## Scroll to your desired Data Model and click on the 'Transform' Data Model

## Make sure to copy the package code snippet (usually Step 2) and paste it in the `packages.yml` file located in your new repository

There are already a few packages in this file, feel free to modify, remove or keep them!

## If needed, change the source location (usually Step 3) of your package to match the name of your Fivetran Connector. You can make this change in the `dbt_project.yml` file located in your new repository

By default, our Data Models will assume your connector is named the default name. If your connector is not named the default name, put **your connector name** (schema name) in the schema portion of this variable. Typically, the database variable is not needed (you can comment out or delete that line if so).

***If you are interested in adding your own custom sql, please follow these steps:***

## Take note of your Fivetran connector name(s) (typically database, files, events or function connectors) and their schemas

In this case, I will want to take note of `postgres_rds_animal_crossing` because this is the schema where my Fivetran loaded data resides. _If you only have one schema, you may not need to take note of the schema. Use your destination to see what schema was created_

## Navigate to your `sources.yml` file that is already in your `models` folder

Paste your connector_name_schema_name to the `schema` section of one of the sources blocks. Then add your table names in the tables sections. If you need help on this part, feel free to read this post on Fivetran Community (https://community.fivetran.com/t5/user-group-for-dbt/sources-how-to-properly-utilize-integrated-scheduling/m-p/648#M56)

## Open your `0_staging` folder in the models directory and navigate to `staging_example_one.sql` and `staging_example_two.sql`

Notice how these query use a source function. We need to make sure we modify these to read for your new source tables you just added in the step prior. Because this is just an example, it is impossible to test that everything works without letting Fivetran surface the logs. This is why it is important to develop with dbt Core or dbt Cloud.

# Step 4 (Link your new repository to Fivetran)

Navigate to Fivetran's Transformations tab in the UI. Either get started or go to settings to begin the setup with GitHub. Add Fivetran's SSH keys to your deploy keys and make sure you enter the ssh address of your repository in the Fivetran UI.
